# MovieFinder React Project

## Introduction

This project is my first experience with React, where I have utilized various important concepts and tools, including `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks. The project was built using Vite as the development environment. I followed the technical challenge provided by Midudev as a guideline for the entire development process.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with React and related technologies. By using Vite as the build tool, I aimed to create a modern, efficient, and responsive web application.

### Features

- **React Components**: The project is built using React, with various components to create a dynamic user interface.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks have been implemented to encapsulate and reuse logic throughout the application.
- **useCallback**: The `useCallback` hook has been used to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useRef**: `useRef` is employed for accessing and interacting with DOM elements efficiently.
- **useEffect**: The `useEffect` hook is utilized for handling side effects, such as fetching data and managing component lifecycles.
- **Vite**: The project utilizes Vite as the development environment, providing a fast and optimized development experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
