# MovieFinder React Project

## Project Overview

The core functionality of this project revolves around a movie search feature. Users can input keywords, and the application will display matching movie posters, titles, and release years. While the project may appear straightforward, it serves as an excellent foundation for practicing React and its associated technologies.

### Features

- **Movie Search**: The primary function allows users to search for movies by entering relevant keywords.
- **Display**: The application displays movie posters, titles, and release years for matching results.
- **React Components**: The project is constructed using React, with a focus on creating reusable components for a dynamic user interface.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks are implemented to encapsulate and reuse logic efficiently.
- **Performance Optimization**: The `useCallback` hook is used to enhance performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **DOM Interaction**: `useRef` is employed for efficient interaction with DOM elements.
- **Side Effects Handling**: The `useEffect` hook is utilized for managing side effects, such as fetching movie data and handling component lifecycles.
- **Vite**: The project harnesses Vite as the development environment, offering a swift and optimized development experience.
- **Responsiveness**: The application is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.
